This will help to carbonate the beer naturally when homebrewing, where specialized equipement to achieve this is unavailable. Corn syrup is the most widely used ingredient for priming and it said to be included in most home brewing kits. This is something we'll try to confirm below).\n\nDoing a bit of research on homebrewing, it seems like priming is an integral part of the process and that it should included in pretty much every recipe. However, it's important to note that giudelines for homebrewing are suggesting to use different amount of sugars depending on the type (style) of beer you're brewing.  The different styles of beer requires different amount of carbonation, so that's not surprising.\n\nI still find it very strange that this information is not available for most of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0a7084b1-7fd6-4a88-a32e-f6620c29a6ef","_uuid":"209d83212443e874c19966864b35e47947d96622","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"null_priming = beer_recipe['PrimingMethod'].isnull()\nprint('Priming Method is null on {} rows out of {}, so {} % of the time'.format(null_priming.sum(), len(beer_recipe), round((null_priming.sum()/len(beer_recipe))*100,2)))","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ef410570-9ea6-49f0-8251-b44fd5b44cfa","_uuid":"bb66072fc941c4c256b627051aa51211e002547f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"wow... it's null 90% of the time.\n\nLet's see if it the same across all styles"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3da6e422-17a7-4cfd-8066-3f741540ab0f","_uuid":"0afe9ea833db11d1d1095ce52ff50c14c5504150","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"style_cnt = beer_recipe.loc[:,['Style','PrimingMethod']]\nstyle_cnt['NullPriming'] = style_cnt['PrimingMethod'].isnull()\nstyle_cnt['Count'] = 1\nstyle_cnt_grp = style_cnt.loc[:,['Style','Count','NullPriming']].groupby('Style').sum()\n\nstyle_cnt_grp = style_cnt_grp.sort_values('NullPriming', ascending=False)\nstyle_cnt_grp.reset_index(inplace=True)\n\ndef stacked_bar_plot(df, x_total, x_sub_total, sub_total_label, y):\n    # Initialize the matplotlib figure\n    f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))\n    \n    # Plot the total\n    sns.set_color_codes(\"pastel\")\n    sns.barplot(x=x_total, y=y, data=df, label=\"Total\", color=\"b\")\n\n    # Plot\n    sns.set_color_codes(\"muted\")\n    sns.barplot(x=x_sub_total, y=y, data=df, label=sub_total_label, color=\"b\")\n    \n    # Add a legend and informative axis label\n    ax.legend(ncol=2, loc=\"lower right\", frameon=True)\n    sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)\n    \n    return f, ax\n    \nf, ax = stacked_bar_plot(style_cnt_grp[:20], 'Count', 'NullPriming', 'Priming Method is null', 'Style')\nax.set(title='Missing Values in PrimingMethod column, per style', ylabel='', xlabel='Count of Beer Recipes')\nsns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)\n","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"aee8f9e9-2bdd-49e4-92bd-6a357cfc0a38","_uuid":"1fbf93d612c45c61bfb0678fe4b51270e2097493"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Upon further reading of the data notes, it seems that the priming fields are not standardized like the other fields.
