It is a complicated and interesting problem combining the data analysis and behavioral psychology.\n\nFor example: Yandex solves the mailbox intruder detection problem based on the user's behavior patterns. In a nutshell, intruder's behaviour pattern might differ from the owner's one: \n- the breaker might not delete emails right after they are read, as the mailbox owner might do\n- the intruder might mark emails and even move the cursor differently\n- etc.\n\nSo the intruder could be detected and thrown out from the mailbox proposing the owner to be authentificated via SMS-code.\nThis pilot project is described in the Habrahabr article.\n\nSimilar things are being developed in Google Analytics and described in scientific researches. You can find more on this topic by searching \"Traversal Pattern Mining\" and \"Sequential Pattern Mining\".\n\nIn this competition we are going to solve a similar problem: our algorithm is supposed to analyze the sequence of websites consequently visited by a particular person and to predict whether this person is Alice or an intruder (someone else). As a metric we will use [ROC AUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). We will reveal who Alice is at the end of the course."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7ea61bf68f64930c08f2d07e60fa4820f341e472"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.
