# Regression, along with classification, is one of the core techniques for working with labeled data and must-have skill for any data scientist. This beginner-friendly challenge will guide you through learning five useful regression techniques with practical, hands-on exercises.

# # Before you begin...
# ___
# 
# ### What will I learn?
# 
# The challenge was designed to be completed over five days by doing one exercise every day. We’ll work with real datasets to help develop an intuitive understanding of how different types of regression models work and how to interpret these models. The five big things we'll learn are:
# 
# * How to pick the right regression technique for your data & plot a regression model
# * How to use diagnostic plots to check your model
# * How to interpret and communicate your model
# * Using multiple input variables to predict your output (AKA multiple regresison)
# * How to pick which set of input variables to use (with Elastic Net)
# 
# ### What do I need to know to get started? 
# 
# This challenge will be taught in the R programming language, and should be accessible for R newbies. Some background in statistics (for example, knowing what a mean or standard deviation is) will be helpful but isn’t required.
# 
# #### Why R? Why not Python?
# 
# R is a programming language developed specifically for statistical computing. Regression is a part of its core functionality and, as a result, there are strong syntactic conventions for regression. This makes it very easy to move between different packages and techniques. While there are many Python libraries for regression, the syntactic differences between them make it more difficult to move between them. You are more than welcome to complete the challenge in other languages, like Python or Julia, I just won’t be providing instructional materials specifically for them.
