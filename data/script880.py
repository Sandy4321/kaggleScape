# In [another notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/dvasyukova/d/kaggle/us-baby-names/persistent-vs-spike-fade-names) I took a look at names that suddenly gain popularity seemingly appearing out of nowhere. I tracked some of them to their likely causes uncovering TV series or movie characters, actors, singers, people from reality shows and sport stars. Then I was interested in finding such influences that made the biggest impact on name popularities.
# 
# ### My approach is as follows:
# 
# - First normalize raw counts within each year and gender so that we look at popularity values like "babies with this name per million born".
# - Then compute year-to-year differences of popularity values.
# - For each name and gender find the maximum popularity gain and the year it happened. Put these on a chart.
# - Google around for possible explanations of points on the chart. I started with the largest gains, then continued with whatever caught my eye on the chart.
# - For a measure of impact strength I use the name's maximum year-to-year popularity gain. This is straightforward and easily quantifiable though it's not a perfect approach for a few reasons. First, it gives an advantage to names that were already on the rise when the impact happened. Second, some of the influences might span a number of consecutive years and are disadvantaged by using only one year. I pool together spelling variants of the same name (like Jamie and Jaime). Please drop me a comment if you think of a better approach to estimating impact strength.
# 
# ### And the winners are:
# 
# 1. The "Linda" song topped the charts in 1947 and gave the name Linda a popularity boost of 23 extra baby girls per thousand.
# 1. Child actress Shirley Temple was Hollywood's number one box-office star from 1935 to 1938. 19 extra baby girls per thousand received this name in 1935 compared to the previous year. The name actually saw a significant popularity boost in 1934 as well and would make number one if we count both years.
# 1. Jaime Sommers - the lead character of "The Bionic Woman" TV series - brought the names Jaime, Jamie and their many variations a boost of 11 extra babies per thousand in 1976.
# 
# The first chart below lists names on their peak years. Where I've found an explanation I've added the name in bold and colored letters, the explanation should be displayed when hovering over the dot. 
# 
# A lot of that chart is still unexplored - feel free to dig around. I'll especially appreciate it if you find the reasons for some big spikes I haven't figured out - like Ashley in 1983, Dewey in 1898, Jason in 1973 or Nicholas in 1978. There's also something interesting in the name Kelly - it appears to have received two distinct impacts.

# ## Linda

# 
# > The recording by Ray Noble and Buddy Clark was recorded on November 15, 1946 and released by Columbia Records. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 21, 1947 and lasted thirteen weeks on the chart, peaking at number one.
# 
# > The recording by Charlie Spivak was released by RCA Victor Records. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on March 28, 1947, and lasted nine weeks on the chart, peaking at number six.
#

#

#

"Amanda" was Waylon Jennings's eighth solo number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for three weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.
# 
# > As recorded by Jennings, "Amanda" had been a track on his 1974 album The Ramblin' Man, but was not released as a single at that time; two other tracks, "I'm a Ramblin' Man" and "Rainy Day Woman," were. More than 4Â½ years later, new overdubs were added to the original track and placed on his first greatest hits album. In April 1979 the song was issued as a single, and it soon became one of the biggest country hits of 1979.
