# ## Disclaimer
# Even I have upvotes from novices or fresh accounts. The extreme share of fresh accounts on that particular kernel is certainly an outlier. However I don't want to blame anyone as I don't know their intentions.
# 
# Although the upvoter information is public I decided to hide the actual user names.
