Non-NA is the groupwith complete entries, Edge-NA is the one with NaN values at both extremes (it is nothing wrong I guess as the service may start later or end earlier.). The last group is Interupted with NaN value(s) appeared during <i>service</i> period. The entire data set is relatively big however the entries that need to be imputed (Interupted) are about 3% of the dataset. As per my analysis above, the imputation method based on K-nearestneight - which was the best during the test - was used for entries with small number of missing values. Entries with large number of missing values within the service period was imputed by linear method. Some instances of the imputed dataset are presented above. It looks quite reasonable even though I used only 1% of the entire dataset sample for KNN.</p>"

However if one needs to impute these too, then I suggest using ffill and bfill methods to do so. I didn't touch Jan2016 column as I am not convinced that this column contains the right values (too much variation from the previous month, 2015-12). One might take this as part of the dataset for analysis. </p>\n",
