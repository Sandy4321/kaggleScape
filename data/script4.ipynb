I can look at the prediction probabilities of the model and see how well they perform when the difference between W/D/L is small or large. Overall, I'd expect probabilities with a small difference between them to be wrong more often than the larger difference. There might be a trend which might suggest an adjustment - even randomly choosing between 2 or 3 results? I don't think this would add much.\n", " 4. Of course, prediction of a season is actually one match at a time for a team, rather than all at once. Therefore, after each match there is more information to adjust the model with, i.e. the latest result. In my mind, I'm thinking that I predict a week's results, and add those results to a 'this season' table and subtract that result from the predicted final season numbers for that team. Eg if Arsenal are predicted to win 12 home games, I subtract the latest win from that result, leaving only 11. I then recalculate the probability which will lower the probability of another home win slightly. Effectively this is taking into account regression to the mean. It won't effect early season much, but might make a difference as the season progresses. This might lead to then looking at trending runs, i.e. whether a team might continue playing above or below their average based on their current run (and possibly historic runs).\n", " 5. Finally, I can create similar models for the specific teams playing head2head, probably using all the history available. Then look at the difference in probability between the h2h and the 3 season average and maybe adjust half way between (or another percentage). This brings into play specific rivalries which may or may not be relevant. Again, I wouldn't expect more than a few percent increase.
