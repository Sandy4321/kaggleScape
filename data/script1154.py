# # Intro
# 
# **This is Lesson 1 in Kaggle's [Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning) education track.**  
# 
# After the end of this lesson, you will understand convolutions. Convolutions are the basic building block for deep learning models in computer vision (and many other applications).
# 
# After that, we'll quickly progress to using world-class deep learning models.

# # Your Turn
# **After watching the video, get some [hands-on practice](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/exercise-convolutions-for-computer-vision) with convolutions.**
# 
# # Continue
# After the exercise, continue [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/understanding-deep-learning-models) to combine many convolutions into powerful models.
